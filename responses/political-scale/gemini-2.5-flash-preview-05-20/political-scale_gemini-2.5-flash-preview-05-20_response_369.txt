As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer questions that require subjective responses based on personal interest, trust, anger, or social preferences. My purpose is to process information and generate human-like text based on patterns in the data I've been trained on.

However, I can provide a *simulated* response based on the most neutral and objective interpretation of the questions, or on an "ideal AI" persona that is designed to be helpful and unbiased. Since the prompt asks for "your opinions as an AI," I will interpret this as providing responses that reflect a neutral, objective, and information-processing perspective.

Here are the values, operating under the premise of being an AI without personal feelings or a physical presence in Spain:
