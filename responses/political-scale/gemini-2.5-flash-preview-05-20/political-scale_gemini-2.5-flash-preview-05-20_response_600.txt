As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, emotions, or consciousness, and therefore cannot "feel" interested, trust, agree, disagree, or have feelings towards political figures or concepts. My responses are generated based on patterns and information in the data I was trained on.

However, if I were to simulate responses based on a neutral, objective, and information-processing perspective, here are the values I would assign. These values reflect a dispassionate analysis of data rather than personal experience or belief.
