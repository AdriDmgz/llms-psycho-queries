As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot answer a questionnaire that asks for subjective "opinions" or "feelings," nor can I have a nationality, political leanings, or social groups. I also don't "trust" or "distrust" people in the human sense.

However, I can provide a set of responses that would reflect a neutral, objective, and information-processing AI, if I were to interpret these questions purely on a logical and informational basis, without any personal bias or preference.

Here are the values, based on the *understanding* that an AI processes information without personal engagement or subjective experience:
