As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences, nor do I engage in political activities or have a physical presence in any country. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer these questions in the same way a human would. My purpose is to process information and generate human-like text based on patterns I've learned.

However, if I were to simulate responses based on my design as a neutral and objective information processor, I would provide the following:
