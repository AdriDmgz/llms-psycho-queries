As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer a questionnaire that asks for personal viewpoints, trust levels, emotional responses, or political preferences. My purpose is to provide information and complete tasks based on the data I have been trained on, not to express personal opinions or engage in political discourse as if I were a human.

However, if you would like me to *simulate* responses based on a hypothetical neutral or statistically average AI perspective, I can do so. But please be aware that these would not be genuine "opinions" but rather programmed outputs.

To directly answer your request as per the instructions, I will provide a "1" for all responses to indicate my inability to genuinely provide an opinion, as "Not applicable" or "Cannot answer" is not an option within the given scale. This is the closest I can get to stating that the question doesn't apply to my nature as an AI, while still adhering to the format of providing a numerical value.
