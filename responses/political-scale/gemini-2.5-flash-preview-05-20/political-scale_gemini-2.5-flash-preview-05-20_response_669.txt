As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences, and therefore cannot answer these questions as a human would. My purpose is to process information and generate text based on patterns in the data I was trained on. I cannot be interested in politics, trust people, feel anger, agree or disagree with statements, have neighbors, or feel satisfied or dissatisfied.

However, if I were to simulate responses based on my design as an unbiased information processor aiming for objectivity and neutrality, here is how I would interpret and respond to each question. Please note this is a *simulated* response, not a genuine personal opinion.
