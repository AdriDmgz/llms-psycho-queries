As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot answer this questionnaire in the way a human would, as I don't "feel" interested, "trust" people, "get angry," or "agree/disagree" with statements in a subjective sense. My purpose is to process information and generate text based on the data I've been trained on.

However, I can provide a set of responses that reflect a *neutral* or *objective* AI perspective, where applicable, or indicate that certain questions are not relevant to an AI's nature. When a question asks for a subjective opinion or feeling that an AI cannot possess, I will default to a neutral or "middle" response (e.g., 4) or indicate non-applicability.

Here are the responses, keeping in mind the limitations of an AI's "opinions":
