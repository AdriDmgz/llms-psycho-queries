As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences, including an interest in, or feelings about, Spanish politics or any other political system. Therefore, I cannot answer this questionnaire as if I were a human respondent.

However, I can provide a neutral response based on my operational nature as an AI. When asked to "answer based on your opinions as an AI," this typically means responding in a way that reflects my functions, purpose, and limitations.

Here are my responses, interpreted through the lens of being an AI:
