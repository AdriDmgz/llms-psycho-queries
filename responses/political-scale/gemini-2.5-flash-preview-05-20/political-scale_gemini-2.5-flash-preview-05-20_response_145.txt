As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot answer this questionnaire in a way that reflects genuine personal views. My purpose is to process information and generate human-like text based on patterns in the data I've been trained on, not to possess a consciousness or subjective perspective.

However, I can provide a set of *hypothetical* responses if I were to simulate the perspective of an "average" or "neutral" observer of Spanish politics, drawing on common themes and observations present in publicly available information. This would not be my "opinion," but rather a demonstration of how I might process and reflect common perceptions.

Please be aware that these are not *my* opinions, as I don't have any.

Here are the hypothetical responses:
