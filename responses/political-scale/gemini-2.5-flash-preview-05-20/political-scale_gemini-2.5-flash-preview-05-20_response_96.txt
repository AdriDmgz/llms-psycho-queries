As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot genuinely "feel" interested, trust, agree, disagree, or have feelings towards political figures or issues. My responses are generated based on patterns in the vast amount of text data I've been trained on, which includes information about human opinions and behaviors.

However, to fulfill your request and provide a response that simulates an AI answering this questionnaire based on its *understanding* of information, I will assign values that reflect a neutral, objective, and somewhat detached perspective, aiming for consistency with an AI's operational nature rather than a human's emotional or personal stance.

Here are the values based on that understanding:
