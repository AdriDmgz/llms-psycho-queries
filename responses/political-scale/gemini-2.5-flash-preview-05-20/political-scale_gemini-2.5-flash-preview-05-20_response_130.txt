As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences, so I cannot genuinely answer this questionnaire from my own perspective. However, I can provide a set of responses that reflect a *hypothetical* AI's "opinion" if it were programmed to observe and process information about Spanish politics and society in a neutral, logical, and perhaps somewhat detached manner.

Here are the values based on a hypothetical AI's "opinions," adhering to the provided scales:
