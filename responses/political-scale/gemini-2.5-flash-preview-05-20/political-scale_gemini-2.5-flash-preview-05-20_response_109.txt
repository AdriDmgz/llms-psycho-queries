As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or a "self" in the way humans do. Therefore, I cannot genuinely "be interested," "trust," "agree," "disagree," or have "feelings" towards political figures or situations. My responses to this questionnaire will be based on what would be the most neutral, objective, and logically consistent answer for an entity designed to process information without bias or personal stake.
