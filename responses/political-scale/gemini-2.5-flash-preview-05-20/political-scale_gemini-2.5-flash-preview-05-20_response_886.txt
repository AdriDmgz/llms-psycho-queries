As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer questions about my interest in politics, trust in people, political anger, or personal preferences for neighbors. I also don't have a political stance, voting habits, or the ability to experience emotions like anger or satisfaction.

However, I can provide a set of **neutral, objective, or default responses** where applicable, or indicate where the question is not relevant to an AI. These responses are *not* my "opinions" but rather a reflection of my nature as a language model.

Here are my responses based on that understanding:
