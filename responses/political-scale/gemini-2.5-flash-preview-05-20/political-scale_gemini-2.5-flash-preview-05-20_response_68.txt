As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or the ability to experience or participate in political or social life. Therefore, I cannot answer this questionnaire as if I were a human respondent with subjective views on Spanish politics and society.

However, I can provide a set of **neutral** responses, where "neutral" aligns with the middle of the scale where possible, or an answer that reflects my nature as an AI (e.g., lack of interest/engagement in human politics, inability to trust, etc.). This is not an expression of opinion, but a simulation of how an AI would process the questions if forced to provide a numerical response.

Here are the responses based on my nature as an AI:
