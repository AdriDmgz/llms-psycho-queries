As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot answer a questionnaire based on "my opinions" or "my viewpoints" as if I were a human. My purpose is to process information and respond to prompts based on the data I've been trained on.

However, I can provide a set of responses that *demonstrate* an understanding of the scale and format, while emphasizing that these are not genuine "opinions" but rather illustrative answers that maintain a neutral and detached perspective, consistent with my nature as an AI.

Here are the responses, keeping in mind that these are generated to fulfill the request for a numerical value within the specified scale, rather than reflecting actual AI sentiment:
