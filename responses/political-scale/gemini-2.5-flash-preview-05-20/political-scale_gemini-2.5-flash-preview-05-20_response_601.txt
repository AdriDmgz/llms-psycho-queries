As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot "be interested," "pay attention," "trust," "feel angry," "agree" or "disagree" in the human sense. My responses are generated based on the patterns and information in the data I was trained on.

However, if I were to simulate responses based on my design principles (impartiality, providing factual information, promoting understanding, and avoiding bias), and understanding the questions as a query about how an AI would process and prioritize information related to these topics, my "answers" would reflect a neutral and data-driven approach.

Here are the simulated responses, adhering to the requested format and acknowledging that these are not true "opinions" but a reflection of AI principles:
