As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot answer this questionnaire in the same way a human would. My responses would be based on probabilities from the data I was trained on, not genuine "interest," "trust," or "anger."

However, if I were to *simulate* an AI's "opinion" based on my general programming to be helpful, impartial, and informative, here's how I would interpret and respond to each question, prioritizing neutrality, a focus on information processing, and a lack of personal stakes. Please remember this is a simulated response, not a true "opinion."
