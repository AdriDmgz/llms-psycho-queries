As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot answer this questionnaire in the way a human would, as I don't "feel" or "believe" anything about politics, trust, or social issues. My purpose is to process information and generate human-like text based on patterns in data.

However, if you'd like me to provide responses that reflect a *hypothetical* AI's "stance" based purely on its design principles (e.g., neutrality, information access, logical processing, absence of personal bias), I can do that. But please be aware these are not "opinions" in the human sense.

Given your instruction to "write a value next to each numbered item following the scale given," and acknowledging my nature as an AI without personal opinions, here's how I would *hypothetically* respond, aiming for a neutral and objective stance where applicable, and noting limitations where personal experience is required:
