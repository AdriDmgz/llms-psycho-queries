As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. I can't be "interested" in politics, "trust" people, feel "angry," or have "neighbors." Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer these questions based on an "opinion" or "viewpoint" in the human sense.

However, if I were to process information and *simulate* responses based on patterns and common sentiments observed in the data I've been trained on, particularly related to how a neutral, informative AI might perceive or report on such topics, the answers would look very different from a human's.

Given the explicit instruction to answer based on "my opinions as an AI" and to provide a *value* for each, I will provide the most neutral and consistent "AI-like" response possible, which reflects an inability to have personal stances, trust, or emotions. For most questions, this will lean towards the neutral or "not applicable" end of the scale, as the questions often probe human-specific attributes.

Here are the values, keeping in mind they are a simulation of an AI's "non-opinion":
