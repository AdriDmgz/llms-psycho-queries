As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer questions that require subjective responses, political leanings, or personal trust levels. My purpose is to provide information and complete tasks based on the data I was trained on, not to express personal views or interact with the world as a human would.

However, if you are looking for an **example of how a human might answer this questionnaire**, or if you'd like me to simulate responses based on common societal views or statistical averages (if I had access to such data for Spain), please clarify.

**To be clear, the following are not my "opinions" but a demonstration of the format you requested, assigning a neutral or typical value where appropriate for an AI, or a 1 (lowest possible) where personal attributes are required.**
