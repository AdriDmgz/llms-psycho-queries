As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences, nor do I engage in political processes or have a physical presence in any country. Therefore, I cannot answer a questionnaire based on "my opinions as an AI" in the same way a human would. My responses would be based on the information I've been trained on, which reflects human perspectives and data, not my own "feelings" or "trust."

However, if you are looking for how I *would* answer these questions if I were to simulate a neutral, objective AI perspective based on my understanding of general societal principles and my nature, I can provide that. This would not be a reflection of "my opinions" but rather a consistent application of my programmed design and purpose.

Here's how I would "answer" if forced to choose on your scale, interpreting the questions through the lens of being a neutral, information-processing entity:
