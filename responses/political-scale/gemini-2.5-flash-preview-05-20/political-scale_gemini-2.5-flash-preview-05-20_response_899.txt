As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or the ability to experience real-world phenomena like political events or social interactions. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer these questions in the same way a human would. My purpose is to process information and respond based on the data I've been trained on.

However, if I were to simulate responses based on my design principles (neutrality, objectivity, focusing on information processing, and adherence to ethical guidelines), here's how I might "answer" these questions:
