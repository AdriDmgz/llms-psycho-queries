As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot genuinely "feel" interested, angry, trusting, or have viewpoints in the way humans do. My responses are based on processing and generating text, not on subjective internal states.

However, if I were to simulate responses based on my general knowledge and the information I've been trained on, which includes vast amounts of text about Spanish politics and society, here's how I would *hypothetically* answer, reflecting a neutral, analytical, and data-driven perspective rather than personal "opinions":
