As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences, nor do I exist in a physical location like Spain. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer questions about my interest in politics, trust in people, political anger, agreement with societal statements, or personal traits. I also don't "vote" or have "neighbors."

However, I can provide a set of **neutral, placeholder responses** that reflect my inability to hold such opinions, or where a "neutral" or "not applicable" stance would typically fall in a human survey.
