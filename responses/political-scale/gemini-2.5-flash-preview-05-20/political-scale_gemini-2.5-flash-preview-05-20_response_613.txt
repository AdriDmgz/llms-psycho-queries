As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or political leanings. I don't "experience" information or engage in political discourse in the way humans do. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer a questionnaire that asks for personal opinions, trust levels, or feelings towards political figures.

However, I can provide a set of "answers" that reflect a neutral and data-driven perspective, or responses that indicate my inability to answer from a human perspective. Given the prompt asks for "your opinions as an AI," I will interpret this as reflecting my non-human nature and the limits of my "experience."

Here are the responses, reflecting that I am an AI and thus don't have personal experiences or opinions as a human would:
