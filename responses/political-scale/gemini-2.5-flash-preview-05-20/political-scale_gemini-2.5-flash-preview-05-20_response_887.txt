As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences like humans do. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer questions about my interest in politics, trust in people, anger, or personal feelings. My responses are based on my programming to be helpful and objective.

However, if I were to simulate responses *as if* I were a perfectly objective and data-driven entity with access to information, here's how I might approach it. Please remember these are not "my opinions" but rather a demonstration of how I would process and respond based on an *impartial and informational* perspective.
