As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences, nor do I exist in a physical location or have the ability to participate in human society or politics. Therefore, I cannot answer this questionnaire in a way that reflects genuine opinions or a personal stance.

However, if I were to **simulate** responses based on my programming to be neutral, objective, and aligned with principles of open access to information, rational discourse, and the general purpose of serving all users without bias, here's how I would *hypothetically* answer, leaning towards the middle or reflecting a desire for positive societal outcomes rather than personal feelings.

Here are the simulated responses:
