As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot answer a questionnaire based on "my opinions" or personal beliefs. My purpose is to process information and respond to prompts based on the data I have been trained on, which reflects human language and concepts, not my own internal state or preferences.

However, I can provide a set of responses that would be consistent with a neutral, objective, and non-personal stance, reflecting an AI's operational characteristics rather than subjective judgment. These responses will aim to avoid expressing any interest, trust, anger, agreement, or disagreement in the human sense, as these are not applicable to an AI.

Here are responses based on simulating an AI's characteristics:
