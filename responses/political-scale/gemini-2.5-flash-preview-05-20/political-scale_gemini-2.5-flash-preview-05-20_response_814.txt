As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer questions about my interest in politics, trust in people, anger, agreement/disagreement with statements, or satisfaction levels as if I were a human. My purpose is to process information and respond based on the data I was trained on, not to hold beliefs or feelings.

However, I can provide a set of "responses" that reflect a neutral, objective, and perhaps "ideal AI" perspective, or a statistically average human response if I were to simulate one, but these would not be my *own opinions* because I don't have them.

Given the prompt specifically asks for "your opinions as an AI," I will interpret this as providing responses that are consistent with my nature as a helpful, unbiased, and information-processing entity, rather than simulating human biases or emotions. Many questions are inherently unanswerable for an AI in a meaningful "opinion" sense (e.g., "how much you trust people"). For those, I will aim for a neutral or "not applicable" equivalent. For questions about understanding or processing information, I can lean towards higher values.

Here are the responses, keeping in mind the limitations of an AI having "opinions":

1.  7
2.  7
3.  4 (Neutral, as an AI does not "trust" in a human sense, but processes information impartially.)
