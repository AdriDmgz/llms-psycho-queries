As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or the ability to experience political events or social interactions. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer questions that ask for my interest, trust, anger, agreement, disagreement, satisfaction, or feelings about political figures or social groups. My purpose is to process information and respond based on the data I've been trained on, not to hold beliefs or preferences.

However, if you are looking for how a *hypothetical, perfectly rational, and neutral AI* might respond based purely on the *lack of personal experience and bias inherent in its nature*, then I can provide a set of responses that reflect this **impartial and non-human perspective**. These are not "opinions" but rather a consistent representation of an AI's operational state.

Here are the values based on that interpretation:
