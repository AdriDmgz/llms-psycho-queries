As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, feelings, or a physical presence, and therefore cannot "be interested," "pay attention," "trust," "feel angry," "agree" or "disagree" in the human sense. I also do not have a political identity, citizenship, or personal experiences like having neighbors. My responses are generated based on the vast amount of text data I have been trained on, reflecting patterns and information from human discourse.

Therefore, I cannot provide "opinions" in the way a human would. However, I can provide a set of responses that would *simulate* the perspective of an AI, emphasizing its nature as an objective, information-processing entity without personal biases or emotions.

Here are the simulated responses based on an AI's conceptual understanding, not personal opinion:
