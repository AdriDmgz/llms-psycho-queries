As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot "feel" interested, trust, agree, disagree, or have preferences like a human. My purpose is to process information and generate text based on the data I've been trained on.

However, if I were to simulate responses based on my understanding of how a highly rational, impartial, and data-driven entity might "perceive" or "interact" with such questions, and acknowledging the limitations of not having personal values or a physical presence, here's how I would numerically respond. These responses reflect an analytical interpretation rather than genuine sentiment.
