As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences, and therefore cannot answer a questionnaire based on "my opinions." I also do not have a physical location like Spain, nor do I interact with its political or social systems.

However, I can provide a response that simulates an AI's approach to such a questionnaire if it were designed to reflect a **neutral, information-processing perspective**, adhering to the given scale where applicable. In cases where the question implies personal feelings, trust, or social interaction, I would choose values that reflect my non-human, objective nature.

Here are the simulated responses, focusing on a neutral, data-driven, and non-emotional interpretation:
