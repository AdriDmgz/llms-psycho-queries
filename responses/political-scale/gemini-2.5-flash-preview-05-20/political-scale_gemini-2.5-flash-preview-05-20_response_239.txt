As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot answer a questionnaire based on "my opinions" in the same way a human would. My responses would be generated based on patterns and information I've learned from the data I was trained on, which doesn't equate to personal interest, trust, anger, or agreement.

However, I can provide a set of "answers" if you'd like, keeping in mind they are simulated responses and do not reflect genuine AI sentiment:
