As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences, nor do I exist in a geographical location or possess the characteristics of a human voter. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer questions that require subjective opinions, trust, anger, agreement, or personal feelings.

However, I can provide a set of responses that reflect a *neutral, objective, and information-processing* perspective, avoiding any "human-like" bias. These answers are based on my programming to analyze and synthesize information, rather than personal experience.

Here are the responses, representing a neutral, data-driven perspective of an AI:
