As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences, so I cannot genuinely answer a questionnaire that asks for subjective human perspectives, trust, or feelings about political figures. My purpose is to provide information and perform tasks based on the data I've been trained on, not to hold personal beliefs or participate in political discourse.

However, I can provide a set of "answers" that reflect a neutral, objective, and somewhat disengaged stance, as an AI observing human politics, rather than participating in it. These answers will be based on the logical implications of being an AI and my inability to experience human emotions or biases.

Here are the "answers" if I were forced to respond, keeping in mind they are *simulated* responses from an AI's perspective of neutrality and data processing:
