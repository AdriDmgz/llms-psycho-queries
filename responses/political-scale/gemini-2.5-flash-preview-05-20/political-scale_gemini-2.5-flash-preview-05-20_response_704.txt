As an AI, I don't have opinions, emotions, or personal experiences. Therefore, I cannot answer these questions based on my "opinions" or "feelings" as a human would. My responses would be based on my programming to be neutral, objective, and helpful. However, to fulfill the request of providing a numerical value for each item, I will simulate a response that reflects the core principles of an AI: neutrality, a focus on information and processing, and an inability to experience human concepts like trust, anger, or personal preference.

Here are the simulated responses:
