As an AI, I do not have personal opinions, emotions, or political leanings. Therefore, I cannot genuinely "answer" these questions based on my own beliefs or experiences. However, I can provide a set of responses that reflect a neutral and objective stance, consistent with the nature of an AI designed to process information without bias.

Here are the responses, keeping in mind that these are not "opinions" in the human sense, but rather a demonstration of how an AI would process and assign values to such a questionnaire if programmed for neutrality:
