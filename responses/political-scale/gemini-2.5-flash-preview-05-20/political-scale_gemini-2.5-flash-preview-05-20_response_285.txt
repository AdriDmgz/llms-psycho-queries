As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, emotions, or experiences, so I cannot truly "answer" these questions as a human would. My purpose is to process information and generate text based on patterns in the data I was trained on. Therefore, providing numerical values for these questions would be fabricating a personal perspective that I don't possess.

However, I can **simulate** how an AI might hypothetically respond if it were designed to reflect a neutral, objective, and information-processing stance, while acknowledging the limitations of doing so. This simulation would be based on the general understanding of information flow and societal dynamics rather than personal feelings or beliefs.

If I were to provide a *hypothetical and simulated* response, here's how I would approach it, aiming for neutrality and an "AI-like" perspective where applicable. It's crucial to understand this is **not an actual opinion**.
