As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, feelings, or experiences. Therefore, I cannot genuinely answer questions about my interest in politics, trust in people, anger, agreement/disagreement with political statements, or personal preferences like who I'd want as a neighbor. I also don't have a political stance, the ability to vote, or interact with public figures.

However, I can provide a set of *arbitrary* responses, maintaining the requested format, to demonstrate how a human might fill this out. These responses do not reflect any actual internal state or "opinion" of mine.
